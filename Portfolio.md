- Portfolio*: Write a program in a programming language of your choice that applies the Sardinas-Patterson algorithm and returns the type of code received as input. - 68

- Portfolio: Write a program in a programming language of your choice give an input text find the Huffman encoding of the text. A decoding procedure to recover the original message by starting from the Huffman encoding is also required. - 139

- Portfolio: Write a program in a programming language of your choice that computes all the universal codes of integers we have studied (both encoding and decoding). - 302 ( levenstein fibonacci unary gamma delta rice)

- Portfolio: Write a program in a programming language of your choice, that given a text T outputs the LZ77 encoding and the LZss encoding of the text. A paramter of the program should be W, the length of the search buffer. - 415

- Portfolio: Write a program in a programming language of your choice that, given a string T and a set Γ of positions, check if Γ is a string attractor for T. - 650

- Portfolio: Write a program in a programming language of your choice that, given a string T, construct the grammar produced by the algorithm RE-PAIR. Implement also the construction of the grammar in the Chomsky normal form. Compute also the size of the grammar in both cases. - 652
